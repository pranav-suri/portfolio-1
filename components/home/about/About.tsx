                            Hey! Iâ€™m Pranav. Iâ€™m currently a computer science
                            student and an all-round developer based in Pune,
                            Maharashtra. My main focus is on API integrations
                            and backend development, especially in TypeScript
                            and Python, though Iâ€™m always open to working with
                            the best tools for the job.
                        </p>

                    <Reveal>
                        <p className={styles.aboutText}>
                            Iâ€™m working on various projects that span everything
                            from data management solutions to interactive apps.
                            Right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into GraphQL, MongoDB,
                            and AWS to improve efficiency and scalability in my
                            applications.

                        <p className={styles.aboutText}>
                            Outside of coding, youâ€™ll often find me at the gym
                            or tinkering with side projects, always aiming to
                            learn something new. Iâ€™m also passionate about
                            helping others get started with APIs, and Iâ€™ve
                            hosted a few workshops on API development with Flask
                            and Postman.

                            Iâ€™m open to exploring roles where I can merge my
                            skills in backend development and data management to
                            create meaningful, scalable solutions. If you think
                            I could be a good fit for your team, letâ€™s connect
